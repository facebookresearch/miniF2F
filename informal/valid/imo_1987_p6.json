{"problem_name": "imo_1987_p6", "informal_statement": "Let $n $ be an integer greater than or equal to 2.  Prove that if $k^2 + k + n $ is prime for all integers $k $ such that $ 0 \\leq k \\leq \\sqrt{n/3} $, then $k^2 + k + n $ is prime for all integers $k $ such that $0 \\leq k \\leq n - 2 $.", "informal_proof": "First observe that if $m$ is relatively prime to $b+1$, $b+2$, $\\cdots$, $2b$, then $m$ is relatively prime to any number less than $2b$. Since if $c\\leq b$, then we can choose some $i$ to make $2^ic$ lies in range $b+1,b+2,\\cdots,2b$, so $2^ic$ is relatively prime to $m$. Hence $c$ is also. If we also have $(2b+1)^2>m$, then we can conclude that $m$ is a prime. Since there must be a factor of $m$ less than $\\sqrt{m}$.\n\nLet $n=3r^2+h$ where $0\\leq h<6r+3$, so $r$ is the greatest integer less than or equal to $\\sqrt{n/3}$.(to see this, just let $r=\\lfloor\\sqrt{n/3}\\rfloor$, then we can write $n=3(r+\\epsilon)^2(0\\leq\\epsilon< 1)$, so $h=6r\\epsilon+3\\epsilon^2\\leq 6r+3$). \n\nAssume that $n+k(k+1)$ is prime for $k=1,2,3\\cdots,r$. We show that $N=n+(r+s)(r+s+1)$ is prime for $s=0,1,2,\\cdots,n-r-2$. By our observation above, it is sufficient to show that $(2s+2r+t)^2>N$ and $N$ is relatively prime to all of $r+s+1,r+s+2,\\cdots,2r+2s$. We have $(2r+2s+1)^2=4r^2+4s^2+8rs+4r+4s+1$. Since $s,t\\ge1$, we have $4s+1>s+2$, $4s^2>s^2$ and $6rs>3r$. Hence $(2s+2r+1)^2>4r^2+2rs+s^2+7r+s+2=3r^2+6r+2+(r+s)(r+s+1)\\ge N$.\nNow if $N$ has a factor which divides $2r-i$ int the range $-2s$ to $r-s-1$, then so does $N-(i+2s+1)(2r-i)=n+(r-i-s-1)(r-i-s)$ which have the form $n+s'(s'+1)$ with $s'$ in range $0$ to $r$."}
