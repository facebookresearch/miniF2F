{"problem_name": "imo_1967_p3", "informal_statement": "Let $k, m, n$ be natural numbers such that $m+k+1$ is a prime greater than $n+1.$ Let $c_s=s(s+1).$ Prove that the product $(c_{m+1}-c_k)(c_{m+2}-c_k)\\cdots (c_{m+n}-c_k)$ is divisible by the product $c_1c_2\\cdots c_n$.", "informal_proof": "We have that $c_1c_2c_3...c_n=n!(n+1)$\n\nand we have that $c_a-c_b=a^2-b^2+a-b=(a-b)(a+b+1)$\n\nSo we have that $(c_{m+1}-c_k)(c_{m+2}-c_k)\\ldots(c_{m+n}-c_k)=\\frac{(m+n-k)!}{(m-n)!}\\frac{(m+n+k+1)!}{(m+k+1)!}$ We have to show that:\n\n$\\frac{(c_{m+1}-c_k)(c_{m+2}-c_k)\\ldots(c_{m+n}-c_k)}{n!(n+1)!}=\\frac{(m+n-k)!}{(m-n)!n!}\\frac{(m+n+k+1)!}{(m+k)!(n+1)!} \\frac 1{m+k+1}$ is an integer\n\nBut $\\frac{(m+n-k)!}{(m-n)!n!}=\\binom {m+n-k}n$ is an integer and ${(m+n+k+1)!}{(m+k)!(n+1)!} \\frac 1{m+k+1}=\\binom {m+n+k+1}{n+1}\\frac 1{m+k+1}$ is an integer because $m+k+1|m+n+k+1!$ but does not divide neither $n+1!$ nor $m+n!$ because $m+k+1$ is prime and it is greater than $n+1$ (given in the hypotesis) and $m+n$.\n\nThe above solution was posted and copyrighted by Simo_the_Wolf.
