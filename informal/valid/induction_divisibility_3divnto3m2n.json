{"problem_name": "induction_divisibility_3divnto3m2n", "informal_statement": "Show that for any natural number $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $3 \\mid n^3 + 2n$ .", "informal_proof": "We show the result by induction on $n$. The result is trivial for $n=0$. Let us assume it is true for $n \\geq 0$.\nWe have $(n+1)^3+2(n+1) = (n^3+3n^2+3n+1) + (2n+2) = n^3+2n + 3n^2+3n+3$. From the induction hypothesis, we know that $3$ divides $n^3+2n$. Since $3$ also divides $3n^2+3n+3$, the result is also true in $n+1$ and we have by induction that the result is true for all $n$."}
