{"problem_name": "numbertheory_xsqpysqintdenomeq", "informal_statement": "Let $x$ and $y$ be rational numbers. Show that if $x^2 + y^2$ is an integer, then $x$ and $y$ have the same denominator.", "informal_proof": "Write $x=\\frac{a}{b}$ with $b>0$ and $gcd(a,b)=1$ and $y=\\frac{c}{d}$ with $d>0$ and $gcd(c,d)=1$. Since $x^2+y^2 = \\frac{a^2d^2+c^2b^2}{b^2d^2}$ is an integer, there is an integer $k$ such that $k(b^2d^2) = (a^2d^2+c^2b^2)$.\nThus, $b^2(kd^2-c^2)=a^2d^2$ and  $d^2(kd^2-a^2)=c^2b^2$. In particular, $b^2\\mid a^2d^2$ and $d^2\\mid c^2b^2$.\nSince $gcd(a,b)=gcd(c,d)=1$, this means $b^2 \\mid d^2$ and $d^2\\mid b^2$. As $b>0$ and $d>0$, we conclude that $b=d$, thus $x$ and $y$ share the same denominator."}
