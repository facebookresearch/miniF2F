{"problem_name": "amc12a_2010_p22", "informal_statement": "What is the minimum value of $f(x)=\\left|x-1\\right| + \\left|2x-1\\right| + \\left|3x-1\\right| + \\cdots + \\left|119x - 1 \\right|$?\n\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 49 \\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 50 \\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 51 \\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 52 \\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 53$ Show that it is 49\\ \\textbf{(A)}.", "informal_proof": "If we graph each term separately, we will notice that all of the zeros occur at $\\frac{1}{m}$, where $m$ is any integer from $1$ to $119$, inclusive: $|mx-1|=0\\implies mx=1\\implies x=\\frac{1}{m}$.\n\nThe minimum value of $f(x)$ occurs where the absolute value of the sum of the slopes is at a minimum $\\ge 0$, since it is easy to see that the value will be increasing on either side. That means the minimum must happen at some $\\frac{1}{m}$.\n\nThe sum of the slopes at $x = \\frac{1}{m}$ is\n\n$\\begin{align*}&\\sum_{i=m+1}^{119}i - \\sum_{i=1}^{m}i\\\\\n&=\\sum_{i=1}^{119}i - 2\\sum_{i=1}^{m}i\\\\\n&=-m^2-m+7140\\end{align*}$\n\nNow we want to minimize $-m^2-m+7140$. The zeros occur at $-85$ and $84$, which means the slope is $0$ where $m = 84, 85$.\n\nWe can now verify that both $x=\\frac{1}{84}$ and $x=\\frac{1}{85}$ yield $49\\ \\textbf{(A)}$.\n\nYou can also think of the slopes playing 'tug of war', where the slope of each absolute function upon passing its $x$-intercept is negated, positively tugging on the remaining negative slopes.\n\nThe sum of the slopes is $1+2+3+4\\dots 119=\\sum_{m=1}^{119}m=\\frac{119\\cdot 120}{2}=60\\cdot 119=7140$\n\nSo we need to find the least integer $a$ such that $1+2+3+\\dots a=\\sum_{n=1}^an=\\frac{a(a+1)}{2}\\ge \\frac{7140}{2}=3570:$\n\n$a(a+1)\\ge 7140\\implies a^2+a-7140\\ge 0\\rightarrow a=84\\text{ exactly!}$\nThis \"exactly\" means that the slope is ZERO between the whole interval $x\\in\\left(\\frac{1}{85},\\frac{1}{84}\\right)$. We can explicitly evaluate both to check that they are both equal to the desired minimum value of $f(x)$:\n\n$\\frac{84+83+\\dots+2+1+1+2+\\dots+33+34}{85}=\\frac{84(85)/2+34(35)/2}{85}=\\frac{85(14+84)/2}{85}=49$\n\n$\\frac{83+82+\\dots+2+1+1+2+\\dots+34+35}{84}=\\frac{83(84)/2+35(36)/2}{84}=\\frac{84(15+83)/2}{84}=49$\n\nThus the minimum value of $f(x)$ is $49$."}
