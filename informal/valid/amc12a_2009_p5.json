{"problem_name": "amc12a_2009_p5", "informal_statement": "One dimension of a cube is increased by $1$, another is decreased by $1$, and the third is left unchanged. The volume of the new rectangular solid is $5$ less than that of the cube. What was the volume of the cube?\n\n$\\textbf{(A)}\\ 8 \\qquad \\textbf{(B)}\\ 27 \\qquad \\textbf{(C)}\\ 64 \\qquad \\textbf{(D)}\\ 125 \\qquad \\textbf{(E)}\\ 216$ Show that it is \\text{(D)}.", "informal_proof": "Let the original cube have edge length $a$. Then its volume is $a^3$.\nThe new box has dimensions $a-1$, $a$, and $a+1$, hence its volume is $(a-1)a(a+1) = a^3-a$. \nThe difference between the two volumes is $a$. As we are given that the difference is $5$, we have $a=5$, and the volume of the original cube was $5^3 = 125\\Rightarrow\\text{(D)}$."}
