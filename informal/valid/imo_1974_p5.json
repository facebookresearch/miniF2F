{"problem_name": "imo_1974_p5", "informal_statement": "Determine all possible values of $S = \\frac{a}{a+b+d}+\\frac{b}{a+b+c}+\\frac{c}{b+c+d}+\\frac{d}{a+c+d}$ where $a, b, c, d,$ are arbitrary positive numbers.", "informal_proof": "Note that $2 = \\frac{a}{a+b}+\\frac{b}{a+b}+\\frac{c}{c+d}+\\frac{d}{c+d} > S > \\frac{a}{a+b+c+d}+\\frac{b}{a+b+c+d}+\\frac{c}{a+b+c+d}+\\frac{d}{a+b+c+d} = 1.$ We will now prove that $S$ can reach any range in between $1$ and $2$.\n\nChoose any positive number $a$. For some variables such that $k, m, l > 0$ and $k + m + l = 1$, let $b = ak$, $c = am$, and $d = al$. Plugging this back into the original fraction, we get \n$S = \\frac{a}{a+ak+al}+\\frac{ak}{a+ak+am}+\\frac{am}{ak+am+al}+\\frac{al}{a+am+al} = \\frac{1}{1+k+l}+\\frac{k}{1+k+m}+\\frac{m}{k+m+l}+\\frac{l}{1+m+l}.$\nThe above equation can be further simplified to \n$S = \\frac{1}{2-m}+\\frac{k}{2-l}+m+\\frac{l}{2-k}.$\nNote that $S$ is a continuous function and that $f(m) = m + \\frac{1}{2-m}$ is a strictly increasing function. We can now decrease $k$ and $l$ to make $m$ tend arbitrarily close to $1$. We see $\\lim_{m\\to1} m + \\frac{1}{2-m} = 2$, meaning $S$ can be brought arbitrarily close to $2$. \nNow, set $a = d = x$ and $b = c = y$ for some positive real numbers $x, y$. Then \n$S = \\frac{2x}{2x+y} + \\frac{2y}{2y+x} = \\frac{2y^2 + 8xy + 2x^2}{2y^2 + 5xy + 2x^2}.$\nNotice that if we treat the numerator and denominator each as a quadratic in $y$, we will get $1 + \\frac{g(x)}{2y^2 + 5xy + 2x^2}$, where $g(x)$ has a degree lower than $2$. This means taking $\\lim_{y\\to\\infty} 1 + \\frac{g(x)}{2y^2 + 5xy + 2x^2} = 1$, which means $S$ can be brought arbitrarily close to $1$. Therefore, we are done.\n$ $"}
