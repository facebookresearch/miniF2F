{"problem_name": "mathd_algebra_251", "informal_statement": "Three plus the reciprocal of a number equals 7 divided by that number.  What is the number? Show that it is 2.", "informal_proof": "Let $x$ be the number.  Converting the words in the problem into an equation gives us $3+\\dfrac{1}{x} = \\dfrac{7}{x}$.  Subtracting $\\dfrac{1}{x}$ from both sides gives $3 = \\dfrac{6}{x}$. Multiplying both sides of this equation by $x$ gives $3x =6$, and dividing both sides of this equation by 3 gives $x = 2$."}
