{"problem_name": "imo_1987_p4", "informal_statement": "Prove that there is no function $f $ from the set of non-negative  integers into itself such that $f(f(n)) = n + 1987 $ for every $n $.", "informal_proof": "We prove that if $f(f(n)) = n + k$ for all $n$, where $k$ is a fixed positive integer, then $k$ must be even. If $k = 2h$, then we may take $f(n) = n + h$. \n\nSuppose $f(m) = n$ with $m \\equiv n \\mod k$. Then by an easy induction on $r$ we find $f(m + kr) = n + kr$, $f(n + kr) = m + k(r+1)$. We show this leads to a contradiction. Suppose $m < n$, so $n = m + ks$ for some $s > 0$. Then $f(n) = f(m + ks) = n + ks$. But $f(n) = m + k$, so $m = n + k(s - 1) \\ge n$. Contradiction. So we must have $m \\ge n$, so $m = n + ks$ for some $s \\ge 0$. But now $f(m + k) = f(n + k(s+1)) = m + k(s + 2)$. But $f(m + k) = n + k$, so $n = m + k(s + 1) > n$. Contradiction. \n\nSo if $f(m) = n$, then $m$ and $n$ have different residues $\\pmod k$. Suppose they have $r_1$ and $r_2$ respectively. Then the same induction shows that all sufficiently large $s \\equiv r_1 \\pmod k$ have $f(s) \\equiv r_2 \\pmod k$, and that all sufficiently large $s \\equiv r_2 \\pmod k$ have $f(s) \\equiv r_1 \\pmod k$. Hence if $m$ has a different residue $r \\mod k$, then $f(m)$ cannot have residue $r_1$ or $r_2$. For if $f(m)$ had residue $r_1$, then the same argument would show that all sufficiently large numbers with residue $r_1$ had $f(m) \\equiv r \\pmod k$. Thus the residues form pairs, so that if a number is congruent to a particular residue, then $f$ of the number is congruent to the pair of the residue. But this is impossible for $k$ odd."}
