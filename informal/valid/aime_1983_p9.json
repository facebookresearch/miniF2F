{"problem_name": "aime_1983_p9", "informal_statement": "Find the minimum value of $\\frac{9x^2\\sin^2 x + 4}{x\\sin x}$ for $0 < x < \\pi$. Show that it is 012.", "informal_proof": "Let $y=x\\sin{x}$. We can rewrite the expression as $\\frac{9y^2+4}{y}=9y+\\frac{4}{y}$.\n\nSince $x>0$, and $\\sin{x}>0$ because $0< x<\\pi$, we have $y>0$. So we can apply [[AM-GM]]:\n\n$9y+\\frac{4}{y}\\ge 2\\sqrt{9y\\cdot\\frac{4}{y}}=12$\n\nThe equality holds when $9y=\\frac{4}{y}\\Longleftrightarrow y^2=\\frac49\\Longleftrightarrow y=\\frac23$.\n\nTherefore, the minimum value is $012$. This is reached when we have $x \\sin{x} = \\frac{2}{3}$ in the original equation (since $x\\sin x$ is continuous and increasing on the interval $0 \\le x \\le \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, and its range on that interval is from $0 \\le x\\sin x \\le \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, this value of $\\frac{2}{3}$ is attainable by the [[Intermediate Value Theorem]])."}
