{"problem_name": "amc12a_2003_p25", "informal_statement": "Let $f(x)= \\sqrt{ax^2+bx} $.  For how many [[real number | real]] values of $a$ is there at least one [[positive number | positive]] value of $ b $ for which the [[domain]] of $f $ and the [[range]] of $ f $ are the same [[set]]?\n\n$ \\mathrm{(A) \\ 0 } \\qquad \\mathrm{(B) \\ 1 } \\qquad \\mathrm{(C) \\ 2 } \\qquad \\mathrm{(D) \\ 3 } \\qquad \\mathrm{(E) \\ \\mathrm{infinitely \\ many} }  $ Show that it is \\mathrm{(B) \\ 2 }.", "informal_proof": "The function $f(x) = \\sqrt{x(ax+b)}$ has a [[codomain]] of all non-negative numbers, or $0 \\le f(x)$. Since the domain and the range of $f$ are the same, it follows that the domain of $f$ also satisfies $0 \\le x$.\n\nThe function has two zeroes at $x = 0, \\frac{-b}{a}$, which must be part of the domain. Since the domain and the range are the same set, it follows that $\\frac{-b}{a}$ is in the codomain of $f$, or $0 \\le \\frac{-b}{a}$. This implies that one (but not both) of $a,b$ is non-positive. The problem states that there is at least one positive value of b that works, thus $a$ must be non-positive, $b$ is non-negative, and the domain of the function occurs when $x(ax+b) > 0$, or \n\n<center>$0 \\le x \\le \\frac{-b}{a}.$</center>\n\n[[Completing the square]], $f(x) = \\sqrt{a\\left(x + \\frac{b}{2a}\\right)^2 - \\frac{b^2}{4a}} \\le \\sqrt{\\frac{-b^2}{4a}}$ by the [[Trivial Inequality]] (remember that $a \\le 0$). Since $f$ is continuous and assumes this maximal value at $x = \\frac{-b}{2a}$, it follows that the range of $f$ is \n\n<center>$0 \\le f(x) \\le \\sqrt{\\frac{-b^2}{4a}}.$</center>\n\nAs the domain and the range are the same, we have that $\\frac{-b}{a} = \\sqrt{\\frac{-b^2}{4a}} = \\frac{b}{2\\sqrt{-a}} \\Longrightarrow a(a+4) = 0$ (we can divide through by $b$ since it is given that $b$ is positive). Hence $a = 0, -4$, which both we can verify work, and the answer is $\\mathbf{(C)}$."}
