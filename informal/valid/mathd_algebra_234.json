{"problem_name": "mathd_algebra_234", "informal_statement": "What is the sixth term in the geometric sequence $\\frac{27}{125}, \\frac{9}{25}, \\frac{3}{5},\\ldots$?  Express your answer as a common fraction. Show that it is \\frac{25}{9}.", "informal_proof": "With common ratio $\\frac{5}{3}$, and first term $\\frac{27}{125}$, we simply take: $\\frac{27}{125}\\times\\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right)^{5}$ which yields $\\frac{25}{9}.$"}
