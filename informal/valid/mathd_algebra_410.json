{"problem_name": "mathd_algebra_410", "informal_statement": "What is the minimum possible value for $y$ in the equation $y = x^2 - 6x + 13$? Show that it is 4.", "informal_proof": "Write $x^2-6x$ as $(x-3)^2-9$ to obtain  \\[\ny=(x-3)^2+4.\n\\]Since $(x-3)^2\\geq0$, we have $y\\geq4$.  The value $y=4$ is obtained when $x=3$. (Note: this method of rewriting a quadratic expression is called ``completing the square'')."}
