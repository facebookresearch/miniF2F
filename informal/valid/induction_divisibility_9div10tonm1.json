{"problem_name": "induction_divisibility_9div10tonm1", "informal_statement": "Show that 9 divides $10^n - 1$ for any natural number n.", "informal_proof": "We use induction. The base case for $n=0$  is true since $9 \\mid 0$.\nAssume the result is true for some $n \\geq 0$. Then $9\\mid 10^n - 1$, and there exists $k$ such that $10^n - 1$ = 9k.\nFinally, rewriting $10^{n+1}-1 = 10*(10^n - 1) + 9=9 * (10*k+1)$, which implies the result for $n+1$."}
