{"problem_name": "aime_1991_p6", "informal_statement": "Suppose $r^{}_{}$ is a [[real number]] for which\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">$\n\\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{19}{100} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{20}{100} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{21}{100} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots + \\left\\lfloor r + \\frac{91}{100} \\right\\rfloor = 546.\n$</div>\nFind $\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor$. (For real $x^{}_{}$, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the [[floor function|greatest integer]] less than or equal to $x^{}_{}$.) Show that it is 743.", "informal_proof": "There are $91 - 19 + 1 = 73$ numbers in the [[sequence]]. Since the terms of the sequence can be at most $1$ apart, all of the numbers in the sequence can take one of two possible values. Since $\\frac{546}{73} = 7 R 35$, the values of each of the terms of the sequence must be either $7$ or $8$. As the remainder is $35$, $8$ must take on $35$ of the values, with $7$ being the value of the remaining $73 - 35 = 38$ numbers. The 39th number is $\\lfloor r+\\frac{19 + 39 - 1}{100}\\rfloor= \\lfloor r+\\frac{57}{100}\\rfloor$, which is also the first term of this sequence with a value of $8$, so $8 \\le r + \\frac{57}{100} < 8.01$. Solving shows that $\\frac{743}{100} \\le r < \\frac{744}{100}$, so $743\\le 100r < 744$, and $\\lfloor 100r \\rfloor = 743$."}
