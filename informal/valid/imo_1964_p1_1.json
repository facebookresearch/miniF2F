{"problem_name": "imo_1964_p1_1", "informal_statement": "Let $n$ be a natural number. Show that if $7$ divides $2^n-1$, then $3$ divides $n$.", "informal_proof": "Since we know that $2^n-1$ is congruent to 0 (mod 7), we know that $2^n$ is congruent to 8 mod 7, which means $2^n$ is congruent to 1 mod 7.\n\nExperimenting with the residue of $2^n$ mod 7: \n\n$n$=1: 2\n$n$=2: 4\n$n$=3: 1 (this is because when $2^n$ is doubled to $2*2^n$, the residue doubles too, but $4*2=8$ is congruent to 1 (mod 7).\n\n$n$=4: 2\n$n$=5: 4\n$n$=6: 1\n\nThrough induction, we easy show that this is true since the residue doubles every time you double $2^n$.\n\nSo, the residue of $2^n$ mod 7 cycles in 2, 4, 1. Therefore, $n$ must be a multiple of 3."}
