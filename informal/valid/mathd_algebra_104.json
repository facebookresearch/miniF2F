{"problem_name": "mathd_algebra_104", "informal_statement": "In a 8 fluid ounce bottle of Vitamin Water, there are 125 calories. How many calories would be contained in a 12 fluid ounce bottle? Express your answer in decimal form. Show that it is 187.5.", "informal_proof": "We know that there are 125 calories in 8 fluid ounces of Vitamin Water, so we can set up the proportion $\\frac{125}{8}=\\frac{x}{12}$, where $x$ is the number of calories contained in a 12 fluid ounce bottle. Solving for $x$, we find that $x=\\left(\\frac{125}{8}\\right)(12)=187.5$ calories."}
