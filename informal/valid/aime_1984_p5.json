{"problem_name": "aime_1984_p5", "informal_statement": "Determine the value of $ab$ if $\\log_8a+\\log_4b^2=5$ and $\\log_8b+\\log_4a^2=7$. Show that it is 512.", "informal_proof": "Use the [[change of base formula]] to see that $\\frac{\\log a}{\\log 8} + \\frac{2 \\log b}{\\log 4} = 5$; combine [[denominator]]s to find that $\\frac{\\log ab^3}{3\\log 2} = 5$. Doing the same thing with the second equation yields that $\\frac{\\log a^3b}{3\\log 2} = 7$. This means that $\\log ab^3 = 15\\log 2 \\Longrightarrow ab^3 = 2^{15}$ and that $\\log a^3 b = 21\\log 2 \\Longrightarrow a^3 b = 2^{21}$. If we multiply the two equations together, we get that $a^4b^4 = 2^{36}$, so taking the fourth root of that, $ab = 2^9 = 512$."}
