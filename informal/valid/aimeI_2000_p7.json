{"problem_name": "aimeI_2000_p7", "informal_statement": "Suppose that $x,$ $y,$ and $z$ are three positive numbers that satisfy the equations $xyz = 1,$ $x + \\frac {1}{z} = 5,$ and $y + \\frac {1}{x} = 29.$ Then $z + \\frac {1}{y} = \\frac {m}{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are [[relatively prime]] positive integers. Find $m + n$.\n\n\nnote: this is the type of problem that makes you think symmetry, but actually can be solved easily with substitution, and other normal technniques Show that it is 005.", "informal_proof": "We can rewrite $xyz=1$ as $\\frac{1}{z}=xy$.\n\nSubstituting into one of the given equations, we have \n$x+xy=5$\n$x(1+y)=5$\n$\\frac{1}{x}=\\frac{1+y}{5}.$\n\nWe can substitute back into $y+\\frac{1}{x}=29$ to obtain\n$y+\\frac{1+y}{5}=29$\n$5y+1+y=145$\n$y=24.$\n\nWe can then substitute once again to get\n$x=\\frac15$\n$z=\\frac{5}{24}.$\nThus, $z+\\frac1y=\\frac{5}{24}+\\frac{1}{24}=\\frac{1}{4}$, so $m+n=005$."}
