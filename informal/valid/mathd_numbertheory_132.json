{"problem_name": "mathd_numbertheory_132", "informal_statement": "What is the remainder of 2004 divided by 12? Show that it is 0.", "informal_proof": "An integer is divisible by 12 if and only if it is divisible by both 3 and 4.  Because $2+0+0+4=6$ is divisible by 3, 2004 is divisible by 3.  Also, the last two digits of 2004 form a multiple of 4, so 2004 is divisible by 4 as well. Therefore, 2004 is divisible by 12 and hence leaves a remainder of $0$ when divided by 12."}
