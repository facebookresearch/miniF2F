{"problem_name": "mathd_numbertheory_188", "informal_statement": "Find the greatest common factor of 180 and 168. Show that it is 12.", "informal_proof": "If a number $d$ divides into both $180$ and $168$, it must also divide into their difference. Thus, $d$ will be divisible by $180 - 168 = 12$. We notice that $12$ divides into both $180$ and $168$, so it follows that $12$ must be the GCF of $180$ and $168$."}
