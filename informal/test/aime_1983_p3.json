{"problem_name": "aime_1983_p3", "informal_statement": "What is the product of the [[real]] [[root]]s of the [[equation]] $x^2 + 18x + 30 = 2 \\sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45}$? Show that it is 020.", "informal_proof": "If we were to expand by squaring, we would get a [[quartic Equation|quartic]] [[polynomial]], which isn't always the easiest thing to deal with.\n\nInstead, we substitute $y$ for $x^2+18x+30$, so that the equation becomes $y=2\\sqrt{y+15}$.\n\nNow we can square; solving for $y$, we get $y=10$ or $y=-6$. The second root is extraneous since $2\\sqrt{y+15}$ is always non-negative (and moreover, plugging in $y=-6$, we get $-6=6$, which is obviously false). Hence we have $y=10$ as the only solution for $y$. Substituting $x^2+18x+30$ back in for $y$,\n\n<center>$x^2+18x+30=10 \\Longrightarrow x^2+18x+20=0.$</center> Both of the roots of this equation are real, since its discriminant is $18^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 20 = 244$, which is positive. Thus by [[Vieta's formulas]], the product of the real roots is simply $020$."}
