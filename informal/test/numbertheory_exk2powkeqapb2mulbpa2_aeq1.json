{"problem_name": "numbertheory_exk2powkeqapb2mulbpa2_aeq1", "informal_statement": "If $a$ and $b$ are positive integers and there exists a positive integer $k$ such that $2^k = (a + b^2) (b + a^2)$, then show that $a = 1$.", "informal_proof": "As $a \\geq 1$ and $b \\geq 1$, $2^k = (a + b^2)(b + a^2) \\geq 4$, then $k \\geq 2$. Since $2^k = (a + b^2)(b + a^2)$, there exists $m \\geq 1$ and $n \\geq 1$ such that $2^m=a+b^2$ and $2^n=a^2+b$. Without loss of generality, we can assume that $b \\geq a$ so that $m \\geq n$ and that there exists $p \\geq 0$ such that $m = n + p$.\n\nWe have that $2^m - 2^n = 2^n (2^p - 1) = (a+b^2)-(a^2+b) = (b-a)(b+a)+(a-b)=(b-a)(b+a-1)$.\n$a$ and $b$ must have the same parity, otherwise $2$ does not divide $a+b^2$. So $b+a-1$ is odd and $2^n \\mid b-a$. As a result, there exists $d$ such that $b=a+(2^n)d$.\nBut $2^n=a^2+b=a^2+a+(2^n)d$, and $a>0$ so necessarily $d=0$ and $a=b$. Also, $2^n=a(a+1)$, which is only possible if $a=1$. So $a=b=1$."}
