{"problem_name": "induction_1pxpownlt1pnx", "informal_statement": "Show that for any real number $x$ and any natural number $n$, if $x > -1$, then $(1+nx)\\leq (1+x)^n$.", "informal_proof": "We show the result by induction on $n$. The result is trivial for $n=0$ or $n=1$. Let us assume the property is true in $n$.\nBy the induction hypothesis we know that $(1+nx)\\leq (1+x)^n$.\nMoreover, as $x > -1$, we have that $x \\leq x (1 + x)^n$. The inequality is trivial if $x \\geq 0$, and is also true if $x < 0$ as $-1 < x < 0 \\implies 0 < (1 + x)^n < 1$.\nSo, $(1+nx) + x \\leq (1+x)^n + x (1+x)^n$ and we have that $(1+(n+1)x) \\leq (1+x)^(n+1)$, so the property is true in $n+1$.\nBy induction, we have that the result is true for any natural number $n$."}
