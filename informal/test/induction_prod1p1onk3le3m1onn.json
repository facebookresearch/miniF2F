{"problem_name": "induction_prod1p1onk3le3m1onn", "informal_statement": "Show that for any positive integer $n$, we have $\\prod_{k=1}^n (1 + 1/k^3) \\leq 3 - 1/n$.", "informal_proof": "We can prove this by induction on n. For the base case, $n=1$, the statement is trivial.\nFor the inductive case, we assume $\\prod_{k=1}^{n_0} (1 + 1/k^3) \\leq 3 - 1/n_0$.\nTherefore, we have $\\prod_{k=1}^{n_0+1} (1 + 1/k^3) \\leq (3-1/n_0) (1 + 1/(n_0+1)^3) = 3 + \\frac{3}{(n_0+1)^3}-\\frac{1}{n_0}-\\frac{1}{n_0 (n_0+1)^3}$.\nIt hence suffices to show that $\\frac{3}{(n_0+1)^3}+\\frac{1}{n_0+1} \\leq \\frac{1}{n_0} + \\frac{1}{n_0 (n_0+1)^3}$, which is equivalent to\n$3n_0 + n_0 (n_0+1)^2 \\leq (n_0+1)^3 + 1$. Simplifying, we get\n$n_0^2 - n_0 + 2 \\geq 0$. This is obviously true for $n\\geq 1$."}
