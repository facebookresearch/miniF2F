{"problem_name": "amc12a_2002_p13", "informal_statement": "Two different positive numbers $a$ and $b$ each differ from their reciprocals by $1$. What is $a+b$?\n\n$\n\\text{(A) }1\n\\qquad\n\\text{(B) }2\n\\qquad\n\\text{(C) }\\sqrt 5\n\\qquad\n\\text{(D) }\\sqrt 6\n\\qquad\n\\text{(E) }3\n$ Show that it is (C) \\sqrt 5.", "informal_proof": "Each of the numbers $a$ and $b$ is a solution to $\\left| x - \\frac 1x \\right| = 1$.\n\nHence it is either a solution to $x - \\frac 1x = 1$, or to $\\frac 1x - x = 1$. Then it must be a solution either to $x^2 - x - 1 = 0$, or to $x^2 + x - 1 = 0$.\n\nThere are in total four such values of $x$, namely $\\frac{\\pm 1 \\pm \\sqrt 5}2$. \n\nOut of these, two are positive: $\\frac{-1+\\sqrt 5}2$ and $\\frac{1+\\sqrt 5}2$. We can easily check that both of them indeed have the required property, and their sum is $\\frac{-1+\\sqrt 5}2 + \\frac{1+\\sqrt 5}2 = (C) \\sqrt 5$."}
